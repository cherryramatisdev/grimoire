# disable-ctlseqs-alt = false

# Fonts

# You can also set family on root to overwritte all fonts
[fonts]

# Scroll
#
# You can change how many lines are scrolled each time by setting this option.
#
# Scroll calculation for canonical mode will be based on `lines = (accumulated scroll * multiplier / divider)`,
# If you want a quicker scroll, keep increasing the multiplier.
# If you want to reduce scroll speed you will need to increase the divider.
# You can use both properties also to find the best scroll for you.
#
# Multiplier default is 3.0.
# Divider default is 1.0.
# Example:
# [scroll]
# multiplier = 3.0
# divider = 1.0

# Navigation
#
# "mode" - Define navigation mode
#   • NativeTab (MacOs only)
#   • CollapsedTab
#   • BottomTab
#   • TopTab
#   • Breadcrumb
#   • Plain
#
# "clickable" - Enable click on tabs to switch.
# "use-current-path" - Use same path whenever a new tab is created.
# "color-automation" - Set a specific color for the tab whenever a specific program is running, or in a specific directory.
#
# Example:
# [navigation]
# mode = "CollapsedTab"
# clickable = false
# use-current-path = false
# color-automation = []

# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. `/bin/fish`.
# Entries in `shell.args` are passed unmodified as arguments to the shell.
#
# Default:
#   - (macOS) user login shell
#   - (Linux/BSD) user login shell
#   - (Windows) powershell
#
# Example 1 using fish shell from bin path:
#
# [shell]
# program = "/bin/fish"
# args = ["--login"]
#
# Example 2 for Windows using powershell
#
# [shell]
# program = "pwsh"
# args = []
#
# Example 3 for Windows using powershell with login
#
# [shell]
# program = "pwsh"
# args = ["-l"]
#
# Example 4 for MacOS with tmux installed by homebrew
#
# [shell]
# program = "/opt/homebrew/bin/tmux"
# args = ["new-session", "-c", "/var/www"]

# Colors
#
# Colors definition will overwrite any property in theme
# (considering if theme folder does exists and is being used)

# cursor = '#F38BA3'
# tabs = '#443d40'
# tabs-active = '#F38BA3'

# blue = '#12B5E5'
# yellow = '#FCBA28'

# Bindings
#
# Create custom Key bindings for Rio terminal
# More information in: raphamorim.io/rio/docs/custom-key-bindings
#
# Example:
# [bindings]
# keys = [
#   { key = "q", with = "super", action = "Quit" },
#   # Bytes[27, 91, 53, 126] is equivalent to "\x1b[5~"
#   { key = "home", with = "super | shift", bytes = [27, 91, 53, 126] }
# ]

# Log level
#
# This property enables log level filter. Default is "OFF".
#
